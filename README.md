# My Nyarch Rice

This is a simple ricing of Nyarch using Hyprland.

Don't ask why Nyarch, I don't know either. 

The config files should work on any one of their respective pieces of software.

I would post on r/unixporn but I *just* created a new Reddit account (deleted the old one) and it won't let me post.

Here was my process for making this:
1. Enabled Nvidia drivers
2. Setup notification daemon (dunst)
3. Setup pipewire
4. Added Qt support
5. Setup authentication daemon
6. Setup monitors
7. Turned down sensitivity
8. Made nayofetch run by default when opening fish
9. Setup screenshot tool (flameshot) (this took a lot of debugging) (I even contributed to an issue with my 2-cents)
10. Learned about regex
11. Made the terminal emulator Kitty tile by default
12. Got Neovim to open links
13. Installed LazyVim (allows vim customisation with plugins and pre-customises some things)
14. Changed cursor to Posy's Cursor
15. Changed the default file manager to Thunar
16. Made inactive windows have an 80% opacity
17. Increased rounding of applications
18. 80% opacity got annoying quickly, reversed it
19. Made a custom Thunar action to open the current directory as root
20. Setup my wallpaper using hyprpaper
21. Added dotfiles to GitHub
22. Set Thunar as default file manager for xdg
23. Tested run menus and settled on rofi
24. Got sidetracked and setup EWW (never used it though)
25. Customised rofi, learning a new language along the way
26. Tried out a few taskbars, settled on waybar
27. Customised waybar
28. Installed a Bluetooth manager that opens when clicking the Bluetooth icon
29. Removed lazyvim and installed vim-plug
30. Finally got Neovim auto-checking indentation
31. Customised dunst (the notification daemon)
32. Changed hyprland border colors
